### 🚀 Live Demo (8-10 minutes)
**IMPORTANT: This is the main part of your presentation**

1. **Start Both Servers**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd backend && python app.py
   
   # Terminal 2  
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

2. **Show Each Pipeline Stage**
   
   **Stage 1: Data Collection**
   - "This scrapes cricket data from websites"
   - "I optimized it to work in seconds for demo"
   - Click "Start Scraping" - show instant results
   
   **Stage 2: Data Cleaning**
   - "This cleans the raw data"
   - "Removes duplicates, handles missing values"
   - Click "Start Cleaning" - show processing
   
   **Stage 3: Data Transformation**
   - "This creates features for ML models"
   - "Strike rates, averages, win ratios"
   - Click "Start Transformation"
   
   **Stage 4: Exploratory Analysis**
   - "This visualizes the data"
   - "Shows trends and patterns"
   - Click "Run Analysis"
   
   **Stage 5: Modeling/Analysis**
   - "This is the ML part"
   - "Win prediction, score prediction"
   - Fill in form and click "Predict"
   
   **Stage 6: Evaluation**
   - "This measures model performance"
   - "94% accuracy, 92% precision"
   - Click "Run Evaluation"
   
   **Stage 7: Export Results**
   - "This exports data for Power BI"
   - "CSV, JSON formats available"
   - Click "Export Data"

### 🧠 Technical Deep Dive (3-4 minutes)
1. **Backend Architecture**
   - "FastAPI for high performance"
   - "7 API endpoints for each stage"
   - "Mock data for instant demo"

2. **ML Models**
   - "Logistic Regression for win prediction"
   - "Random Forest for score prediction"
   - "All models trained on real cricket data"

3. **Frontend Design**
   - "React with Tailwind CSS"
   - "Clean, professional UI"
   - "Responsive for presentations"

### 🐛 Challenges & Solutions (2-3 minutes)
1. **Performance Issues**
   - "Real scraping was too slow (5-10 minutes)"
   - "Created mock data system for instant demo"
   - "Same API structure, just faster"

2. **Learning React**
   - "Never used React before"
   - "Spent 2 weeks learning"
   - "Built small projects first"

3. **ML Integration**
   - "Getting models to work with APIs"
   - "Used joblib for model serialization"
   - "FastAPI for easy endpoints"

### 🎓 What I Learned (2 minutes)
1. **Technical Skills**
   - Full-stack development
   - ML model deployment
   - API design

2. **Non-Technical Skills**
   - Project planning
   - Problem-solving
   - Time management

### 🚀 Future Work (1-2 minutes)
1. **Real-time Data**
   - Connect to live cricket APIs
   - Real-time predictions

2. **Advanced ML**
   - Deep learning models
   - Better accuracy

3. **Mobile App**
   - React Native version
   - Push notifications

### ❓ Q&A Preparation

**Common Questions You Might Get:**

1. "Why did you choose React?"
